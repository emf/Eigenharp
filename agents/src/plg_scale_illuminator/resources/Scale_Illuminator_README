Overview 
=========
Scale illuminators purpose is to highlight scales and tonics.
There are considered to be two scale & tonics.
- The playing scale & tonic - this is the scale being used to play i.e. sounds notes
- The reference scale & tonic - this is the scale that you wish to be highlighted.

The playing scale comes from the keygroup that the scale illuminator is connected to, i.e. the one that drives the notes :o) 
(note: we do not know or care about the scalers scale, if you are overriding!!)
The reference scale is on the scale illuminator.

Scale illuminator runs in one of two mode, normal or inverted.
normal, notes from the playing scale which are in the reference scale are coloured green, others are blank
inverted, notes from the playing scale which are NOT in the reference scale are coloured red, others are blank

if the root attribute is set, then REFFERENCE tonic are lit , green in inverted mode, red in normal mode.

lets look at some examples!

Keygroup (playing scale) = C Chromatic  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = false (default) 
Green keys are note of C Major, and red key is C

Keygroup = C Chromatic  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = TRUE 
Red keys are notes NOT in C Major, and green key is C

Keygroup = C Major  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = false (default) 
Since all keys are by definition in reference keys, they are all green, EXCEPT C which is a tonic so is in red

Keygroup = C Major  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = TRUE 
Since all keys are by definition in reference keys, they are all clear EXCEPT C which is a tonic so is in green


Two last interesting cases...
a) Keygroup does not have a scale... well actually this is not true, EigenD assume no scale is Major.
b)Scale Illuminator does not have a scale i.e. no reference scale.
This is interesting! if you dont set a reference scale (or you clear it using the clear verb), then Scale illuminator assume theres is no reference,
and so it will highlight the PLAYING tonic.

the reason this is interesting is if you are using the harp in scale mode, i.e. switching between non-chromatic scales, then you probably only want the
playing tonics lit.

consider this case:
Keygroup = C Major  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = true  
Since all keys are by definition in reference keys, they are all clear EXCEPT C which is a tonic so is in green
so far so good....
now you decide you want to play in D Major, but forget about the illuminator, so you just change playing tonic
Keygroup = D Major  Reference= C Major, root = true (default), inverted = true
What are you expecting to see?
Well what you will see F(#) and C(#)shown in red, as F# and C# are not in C major, and no tonic is lit because the (reference) tonic is
C, but C is not in the playing scale, so there is no C key to display in gree.
This is fine, and correct - but perhaps not what many expect, because they have forgotten about the reference scale.
so to correct, you would have to switch the reference also to D Major, 
but if your just playing in scale mode, this becomes tedious as your not interested in the reference scale.
So what you should do, to avoid this is clear the reference scale using 'scale clear'
Now... as mentioned above, all notes are clear, and the tonic is considered to be the playing tonic NOT the reference tonic as in the normal case.
this case is worth remembering as otherwise it will be a source if 'why are these lights lit' :o)



Install
=========

Install by double clicking package, this will install agent and also demo scripts.

you can find a demo script for each device, (alpha is for factory setup 3, but works with 1 & 2)
use commander  (or script browser to execute)
e.g
alpha scale illuminator execute

to change the reference scale/tonic, you need to use the belcanto below (or use workbench)


Also see at bottom a list of alternative scripts available

alternatively you can do manually, just use  workbench to connect agent to keygroup output of choice
change reference scale & tonic
inverted = false, shows notes of scale in green, inverted = true, shows note not in scale in red
root = true, show root/tonic of scale in red = normal green = inverted.
e.g.
scale illuminator hey tonic to notec set
scale illuminator hey scale to major set
scale illuminator hey scale to 0 , 2 , 4 , 5, 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 set
scale illuminator hey inverted toggle set
scale illuminator hey root toggle set
scale illuminator hey scale clear

TO USE:
ENJOY !!!

PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS
====================
None

CHANGE HISTORY
==============
known issues :
- course notes cannot exceed length number of entries - due to issue in EigenD

change log:
0.1 - initial release
0.1.1 - if no ref scale, then use playing tonic, correct version number 
0.1.2 - tonics are now displayed red = normal green = inverted
0.1.3 - working around keygroups not having a scale set, seen in alpha factory 2 & 3
0.1.4 - added missing midi connections to demo scripts (tau/alpha)
0.1.5 - support setting scale and tonic by name, default KG scale to major, change demo scripts  to use scale illuminator as agent name
0.1.6 - fix issue with offset with non-chromatic scales causing incorrect tonic, add Antonios script, fix issue with KG not getting control by alt implementation
0.1.7 - add clear scale
0.1.8 - add base note and semitone interval support
