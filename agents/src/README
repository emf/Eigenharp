This is the technobears library for EigenD agents.

The tools directory is as supplied by Eigenlabs.
The SConscript in the top directory is a mixture of that used for contribs and eigend. it is similar in the later, so that only one package is built,
not one per plugin. which could become a bit of a pain for release

Liblo is included since it is needed to build plg_oscpad, it must be the same version as used by EigenD to avoid incompatibilities,
unfortunately at this time Eigenlabs do not export the headers for 3rd party libraries so this has to be a manual step.


to build, 
go to top level directory
make

to make a release package type
make mpkg

to you can do manually with 
sudo installer -pkg ./tmp/pkg/pkg/Technobear-2.0.stable.pkg -target /

or just copy the file somewhere, and then double click on it in finder
