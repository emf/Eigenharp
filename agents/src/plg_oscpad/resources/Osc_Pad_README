RELEASE 0.9

Contributions
=============
Mark Harris - OSC Pad agent & pico osc pad
Randy Brown - tau osc pad
Antonio Machado - alpha osc pad



Overview & Install
==================
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT ONLY!!!!!
it is not finished, and has a number of shortcomings its really just a demo to play with at this stage

Ive played with it on a demo of Live 9, but should work on 8 too


TO USE:
a) first install LIVE OSC , following instructions at http://livecontrol.q3f.org/ableton-liveapi/liveosc/
but essentially, copy the LiveOSC directory found with this agent to:
/Applications/Ableton\ Live\ 9.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI\ Remote\ Scripts 

b) In ableton, setup LiveOSC as control surface in preferences

c) install into factory setup by
start EigenD, load factory setup
start commander and execute the script using the following belcanto
interpreter hey pico osc pad execute
or 
interpreter hey tau osc pad execute
or
interpreter hey alpha osc pad execute

then save the setup

OR c) use one of the other setups described in the contributions section below

OR c) you can manually add to your own setup
start EigenD, and in workbench create a new 'osc pad' agent, and connect it to the keyboard / keygroup of your choice. 


ENJOY !!!
