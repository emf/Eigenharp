The VI files here provide 3 features:
- ability to execute belcanto commands from with vi, see below
- syntax colouring for belcanto words
- word completion for belcanto words

Inside this directory you will find the following:
(use ls -al to see them, as they are hidden!)

.vimrc  - this goes into your user root directory, you can add it the end of your existing one if you have it
.vim - this again, goes into your existing root directory

note: you will also need the bash script files help in this repo in /bin , to be able to execute belcanto using F2
