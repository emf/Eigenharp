bewarned the tau is a bit wierd for keygroup layouts as it has 
16 rows in columns 1 and 2 and 20 in 2 and 3.
Keygroup layout takes this into account, by assuming it really has 20 keys in all columns and then, reducing this down to 16 where necessary.

so when quoting the kgEnd, we say it has 20 rows.
